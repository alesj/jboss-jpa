    * each EM (via EE sharing of managed connections).  Or same EM (same name) for each bean
    * in the transaction.  The third case, would be separate EM (different name) per bean
    * in the transaction and different resource managers (multiple DB servers).
    *
    * The Extended PersistenceContext (XPC) has the same capabilities as above, with an extended lifetime that
    * is potentially long term.  Work done outside of a transaction, is queued up until the next transaction is
    * committed or rolled back.  Work done inside of a transaction is committed like a PC would do.
